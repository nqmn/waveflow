## Task: Phase 2 Array Quantization Helpers
Mode: Standard
Risk: Medium
Confidence: Stable
Operational risk: Contained / Trivial
Rollback plan: Revert this task's new helper/test files and export additions.
Change budget: files 3 functions: quantization helpers interfaces: risnet.arrays exports state mutations: None

### Scope
- risnet/arrays/quantization.py - additive uniform phase quantization helpers.
- risnet/arrays/__init__.py - export the additive helpers.
- tests/test_array_quantization.py - equivalence coverage against existing quantization code.

### Steps
- [x] Inspect current quantization APIs
- [x] Add additive array quantization wrappers
- [x] Add equivalence tests
- [x] Run focused and full verification

### Review
- Completed: Added additive quantization helpers and equivalence tests.
- Out-of-scope flagged: Pre-existing staged file moves and FUTURE.md changes were not touched.
- Assumptions invalidated: None.
- Known debt (acknowledged):
- Limitations:

## Task: Phase 2 Route Low-Risk Array Call Sites
Mode: Standard
Risk: Medium
Confidence: Stable
Operational risk: Contained / Trivial
Rollback plan: Revert the internal delegation edits in controller/ris_phase.
Change budget: files 3 functions: PhaseSteeringEngine._synthetic_element_positions, PhaseSteeringEngine.linear_steering_phases, PhaseQuantizer mapping helpers, UniformQuantizer.quantize interfaces: None state mutations: None

### Scope
- controller/ris_phase/phase_steering.py - delegate steering geometry/math to additive array primitives.
- controller/ris_phase/phase_quantization.py - delegate uniform quantizer mapping/math to additive quantization primitives.
- tests/test_array_primitives.py and tests/test_array_quantization.py - keep equivalence coverage meaningful after delegation.

### Steps
- [x] Route steering helpers through array primitives
- [x] Route uniform quantization helpers through array primitives
- [x] Run focused and full verification

### Review
- Completed: Routed low-risk steering and uniform quantization methods through array primitives.
- Out-of-scope flagged: Pre-existing staged file moves and unrelated modified docs/config remain untouched.
- Assumptions invalidated: None.
- Known debt (acknowledged):
- Limitations:
