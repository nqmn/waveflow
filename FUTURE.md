# RISNet v3 - Future Architecture Direction

## Implementability Verdict

RISNet v3 is implementable in this codebase, but it should be delivered as an
incremental architecture migration rather than a direct folder reshuffle or
rewrite.

The current repository already contains useful foundations for the v3 direction:

- `core/nodes.py` provides the existing `AccessPoint`, `RIS`, and `UE` node model.
- `core/network.py` provides the current AP -> RIS -> UE simulation path.
- `core/environment.py` isolates basic walls, bounds, and line-of-sight checks.
- `core/waveform.py` already contains OFDM, propagation channel, antenna array,
  and RIS reflection primitives.
- `controller/pathfinding` and `controller/beamsweeping` already use registry
  patterns that can evolve into a broader plugin ecosystem.
- `controller/beamsweeping/ml` already contains ML-guided beam sweeping and
  dataset/model tooling.
- `app/` is already an interface layer rather than the core simulator, which
  supports the headless-first goal. It still has some coupling to CLI
  serialization helpers through `app/state_manager.py`.
- `examples/` and notebooks already exist, which supports notebook-native
  research workflows.

The main blocker is not missing RF math. The main blocker is coupling:
`RISNetwork.connect()` currently combines topology lookup, phase computation,
FOV validation, link-budget calculation, fading, feedback handling, active-link
state updates, and API serialization. This method should be decomposed before
introducing the v3 kernel, entity-component model, or spatial channel engine.

Packaging also needs cleanup before a full v3 package layout. `pyproject.toml`
currently packages only `risnet`, while most implementation modules live as
top-level packages such as `core`, `controller`, `cli`, `app`, `config`, and
`utils`. After editable installation, importing `risnet` from outside the
repository fails because `risnet/__init__.py` imports unpackaged top-level
modules such as `core`. The console entry point also references
`risnet.__main__:main`, but there is no `risnet/__main__.py`.

## Vision

RISNet should evolve from:

```text
RIS network simulator
```

into:

```text
Programmable RF intelligence and electromagnetic environment platform
```

The long-term objective is not to compete directly with CST Studio or HFSS in
full-wave electromagnetic simulation.

Instead, RISNet should become:

- AI-native RF simulation platform
- programmable wireless environment framework
- phased-array experimentation platform
- RIS + MIMO + ISAC research toolkit
- notebook-native research environment
- scalable RF digital twin runtime

## Core Philosophy

RISNet v3 should be:

- headless-first
- notebook-native
- CLI-driven
- plugin-oriented
- tensorized
- event-driven
- extensible by design
- AI-native

The architecture should prioritize:

1. composability
2. reproducibility
3. experimentation speed
4. scalable abstractions
5. future-proof simulation primitives

## Current State

The current architecture is primarily:

```text
AP -> RIS -> UE
```

centric.

The future architecture should become:

```text
wave-centric
array-centric
environment-centric
```

where RIS is treated as:

```text
passive phased array
```

instead of a special hardcoded entity.

## Migration Principle

Do not replace `AccessPoint`, `RIS`, `UE`, or `RISNetwork` immediately.

Instead:

1. Preserve the existing public API and CLI behavior.
2. Extract reusable simulation primitives from existing classes.
3. Add adapter layers that let old node objects expose new components.
4. Move new capabilities into v3-style modules.
5. Retire old internals only after tests and examples have migrated.

## Core Architectural Goals

### 1. Simulation Kernel

Introduce a dedicated simulation runtime kernel.

Proposed structure:

```text
kernel/
├── scheduler/
├── runtime/
├── events/
├── execution/
└── registry/
```

Responsibilities:

- event scheduling
- runtime execution
- dependency graph management
- simulation clock
- deterministic reproducibility
- future distributed execution

Implementation note:

Start with a minimal deterministic event loop. Do not start with distributed
execution. The first useful kernel should support scheduled mobility updates,
channel refreshes, beam updates, and metric collection.

### 2. Entity-Component Architecture

Move away from rigid node-based inheritance.

Current model:

```python
AccessPoint
RIS
UE
```

Future model:

```python
Entity(
    components=[
        Position(),
        RFEmitter(),
        RFReceiver(),
        AntennaArray(),
        Beamformer(),
        MobilityModel(),
    ]
)
```

This enables:

- RIS
- phased arrays
- radar
- ISAC
- localization
- mobile arrays
- SDR integration
- cooperative sensing

Implementation note:

Introduce components as additive wrappers first. Existing `AccessPoint`, `RIS`,
and `UE` should be adaptable into entities rather than deleted. For example:

- `AccessPoint` maps to `Position + RFEmitter + Antenna`
- `UE` maps to `Position + RFReceiver + FeedbackReporter`
- `RIS` maps to `Position + AntennaArray + PassiveReflector + Quantizer`

### 3. Phased Array Core Support

Phased arrays should become a first-class primitive.

Proposed structure:

```text
arrays/
├── geometry/
├── steering/
├── beamforming/
├── calibration/
├── codebooks/
└── visualization/
```

Planned support:

- ULA
- UPA
- circular arrays
- sparse arrays
- conformal arrays
- analog beamforming
- digital beamforming
- hybrid beamforming
- adaptive beamforming
- RL-based beamforming
- steering vectors
- array factor computation
- codebooks
- polarization
- calibration
- mutual coupling
- beam pattern analysis

Implementation note:

This is one of the most immediately implementable parts. Existing logic in
`core/waveform.py`, `core/nodes.py`, `core/physics.py`, and
`controller/ris_phase` can be extracted into reusable array modules.

### 4. Spatial Channel Engine

Move from link-based propagation toward spatial channel modeling.

Proposed structure:

```text
channels/
├── spatial/
├── fading/
├── mimo/
├── raytracing/
└── stochastic/
```

Planned features:

- AoA/AoD modeling
- multipath propagation
- Doppler effects
- delay spread
- polarization effects
- mobility-aware fading
- MIMO channels
- RIS-assisted channels

Implementation note:

Start with a `ChannelModel` protocol and a `LinkBudgetChannel` adapter around
the current `Physics` and `RISNetwork.connect()` behavior. Then add spatial and
MIMO models without breaking current tests.

### 5. Environment Scene Graph

Replace the simple wall/obstacle system with a scene graph architecture.

Proposed structure:

```text
world/
├── geometry/
├── materials/
├── actors/
├── mobility/
├── terrain/
├── weather/
└── sensors/
```

Material properties:

- permittivity
- conductivity
- reflectivity
- roughness
- scattering
- absorption

Implementation note:

Keep `Environment` and `Wall` as compatibility objects. Add a `Scene` model
that can import/export current wall data. Avoid forcing 3D dependencies such as
Open3D, Trimesh, or PyVista into the base install.

### 6. Signal Flow Architecture

Waveform simulation should evolve into graph-based signal processing.

Example pipeline:

```text
Signal Source
 -> Modulator
 -> Channel
 -> Array Processing
 -> Beamforming
 -> Receiver
 -> Decoder
 -> Metrics
```

Proposed structure:

```text
signals/
├── modulation/
├── waveform/
├── ofdm/
├── coding/
├── synchronization/
└── pipelines/
```

Implementation note:

Existing waveform primitives can move behind a simple pipeline interface before
adding GNU Radio-style graph execution.

### 7. AI-Native Runtime

RISNet should evolve into a reinforcement-learning-ready environment.

Proposed structure:

```text
ai/
├── rl/
├── datasets/
├── optimization/
├── agents/
└── training/
```

Planned features:

- observation spaces
- action spaces
- reward engines
- online learning hooks
- dataset export
- replay buffers
- multi-agent coordination

Gym-compatible API:

```python
obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
```

Implementation note:

Start with a small adapter around existing beam-sweeping and SNR feedback. Do
not require Gymnasium, PyTorch, or JAX in the base install. Put ML/RL backends
behind optional extras.

### 8. Event-Driven Simulation

Introduce a discrete-event simulation runtime.

Proposed structure:

```text
runtime/
├── clock/
├── events/
├── scheduling/
└── synchronization/
```

Planned features:

- mobility evolution
- scheduling
- traffic simulation
- synchronization timing
- online adaptation
- time-varying channels

Implementation note:

This should depend on the kernel and scenario APIs. It should not be embedded
inside `RISNetwork.connect()`.

### 9. Notebook-Native Research Workflow

RISNet v3 should prioritize notebook workflows over GUI-first development.

Planned notebook collections:

```text
notebooks/
├── beamforming/
├── ris/
├── phased_arrays/
├── localization/
├── radar/
├── isac/
├── rl/
└── benchmarks/
```

Goals:

- rapid experimentation
- reproducibility
- visualization
- parameter sweeps
- ML integration
- publication workflows

Implementation note:

Examples should be converted into scenario-backed notebooks where possible.
Notebook dependencies should remain optional.

### 10. CLI-First Workflow

RISNet should remain headless-first.

Example future CLI:

```bash
risnet scenario run urban.yaml
risnet benchmark run massive_mimo
risnet plugin list
risnet array plot ula.yaml
risnet shell
```

Planned tools:

- Typer
- Rich
- Textual

Implementation note:

The current CLI is `cmd.Cmd`-based and large. Add Typer commands beside the
current CLI first, then gradually route old commands through new service APIs.

### 11. Plugin Ecosystem

RISNet should evolve toward a universal plugin architecture.

Proposed structure:

```text
plugins/
├── propagation/
├── arrays/
├── optimization/
├── channels/
├── datasets/
└── visualization/
```

Plugin types:

- propagation models
- channel models
- beamforming strategies
- optimization algorithms
- datasets
- visualization modules
- hardware drivers
- waveform pipelines

Implementation note:

The beamsweeping registry is a better model than the pathfinding singleton. Use
explicit registration metadata, aliases, and conflict detection. Avoid global
state where reproducibility matters.

### 12. Hardware Abstraction Layer

Future support for hardware-in-the-loop experimentation.

Proposed structure:

```text
devices/
├── sdr/
├── drivers/
├── streaming/
└── synchronization/
```

Planned integrations:

- GNU Radio
- USRP
- BladeRF
- HackRF
- RTL-SDR
- SoapySDR

Implementation note:

Keep this out of the base runtime. Hardware support should be optional,
interface-driven, and mockable in tests.

### 13. Tensorized Compute Backend

RISNet should move toward tensorized simulation.

Planned backends:

- NumPy
- CuPy
- PyTorch
- JAX

Goals:

- GPU acceleration
- vectorized propagation
- scalable phased arrays
- differentiable simulation
- AI-native execution

Implementation note:

Start with a backend protocol and NumPy implementation. Avoid rewriting all
math for GPU before array/channel APIs are stable.

### 14. Visualization Strategy

Visualization should remain modular and optional.

Terminal visualization:

- Rich dashboards
- Textual TUI
- runtime monitoring

Notebook visualization:

- Plotly
- PyVista
- Open3D

Future GUI:

- optional web dashboards
- optional 3D visualizers
- optional collaborative interfaces

Implementation note:

The existing Flask app should remain an interface layer, not the owner of
simulation state or simulation logic.

### 15. Differentiable RF Simulation

Long-term research direction.

Future goals:

- learnable beamforming
- differentiable RIS optimization
- end-to-end PHY learning
- gradient-based RF optimization

Potential backends:

- PyTorch
- JAX

Implementation note:

This is a later-stage goal. It depends on tensorized arrays, spatial channels,
and pure functions with minimal hidden mutable state.

## Proposed Future Folder Structure

Target structure:

```text
risnet/
├── kernel/
├── runtime/
├── world/
├── physics/
├── arrays/
├── channels/
├── signals/
├── optimization/
├── ai/
├── devices/
├── visualization/
├── scenarios/
├── benchmarks/
├── notebooks/
├── plugins/
├── interfaces/
└── cli/
```

Implementation note:

Do not move every existing top-level package at once. First fix packaging so
the project can reliably install and run tests. Then migrate modules in slices.

## Recommended Technology Stack

Core:

| Purpose | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| CLI | Typer |
| Terminal UI | Rich |
| TUI | Textual |
| Notebook | Jupyter |
| Configs | Pydantic |
| Serialization | YAML |

Scientific compute:

| Purpose | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| CPU compute | NumPy |
| Scientific compute | SciPy |
| GPU compute | CuPy |
| Tensor engine | PyTorch |
| Differentiable compute | JAX |

Geometry and visualization:

| Purpose | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| 2D geometry | Shapely |
| 3D geometry | Trimesh |
| 3D processing | Open3D |
| Interactive plots | Plotly |
| Volumetric visualization | PyVista |

Implementation note:

Most of these should be optional extras. Keep the base install lightweight.

## Recommended Development Phases

### Phase 0 - Stabilization Prerequisites

- Fix package layout and console entry point.
- Decide whether top-level packages remain top-level or move under `risnet/`.
- Package the actual implementation modules, not only the thin `risnet/`
  facade.
- Add `risnet/__main__.py` or update the entry point to target an existing
  module.
- Ensure editable install works when commands are launched from outside the
  repository root.
- Add CI test commands for a minimal core test set.
- Separate heavyweight optional dependencies from base dependencies.

### Phase 1 - Extract Simulation Primitives

- Extract array geometry and steering primitives.
- Extract link-budget/channel model interfaces.
- Extract phase quantization and phase solving behind interfaces.
- Add scenario loading API around existing JSON/YAML topology concepts.
- Add compatibility adapters for `AccessPoint`, `RIS`, and `UE`.

### Phase 2 - Introduce Runtime Foundations

- Add minimal kernel clock and event queue.
- Add deterministic seeded execution context.
- Add scheduled mobility/channel update events.
- Add scenario runner independent of Flask and interactive shell.
- Keep `RISNetwork.connect()` as a compatibility facade.

### Phase 3 - Spatial Channels and MIMO

- Add AoA/AoD channel representation.
- Add MIMO channel matrices.
- Add array-to-array channel evaluation.
- Add RIS-assisted spatial channel model.
- Add regression tests for angles, SNR, path loss, and beam patterns.

### Phase 4 - AI Runtime and Datasets

- Add observation/action/reward interfaces.
- Add Gym-compatible environment adapter.
- Add dataset export and replay buffer utilities.
- Move ML training scripts into structured tools or package modules.

### Phase 5 - Hardware and Digital Twin Runtime

- Add mockable SDR interfaces.
- Add optional hardware backends.
- Add runtime monitoring and streaming hooks.
- Add distributed execution only after deterministic local execution is stable.

## Immediate Action Items

The next practical engineering tasks are:

1. Fix packaging and entry points.
2. Add a small `arrays/` module with ULA/UPA geometry and steering vector tests.
3. Extract a `ChannelModel` interface and wrap current link-budget behavior.
4. Split `RISNetwork.connect()` into smaller internal services without changing
   its public return shape.
5. Add a scenario runner that can execute AP -> RIS -> UE through the new
   service layer.
6. Keep Flask, notebooks, and CLI as clients of the same headless service APIs.

## Risks

- A direct rewrite would likely break the CLI, examples, and tests.
- Moving files before fixing packaging will make imports harder to reason about.
- Adding GPU, RL, or hardware dependencies to the base install will make the
  project harder to run and test.
- Entity-component architecture can become over-abstracted if introduced before
  array and channel primitives are stable.
- The existing tests include some expectations that may be stale relative to the
  current physics implementation, such as RIS array gain behavior.

## Final Direction

RISNet v3 should become:

```text
Headless programmable RF simulation core
+
CLI orchestration
+
Notebook-native experimentation
+
AI-native wireless systems runtime
```

with phased arrays, RIS, waveform simulation, and intelligent optimization built
on top of reusable simulation primitives.
